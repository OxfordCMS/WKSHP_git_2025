# Collaborative coding workshop 2025
This is a workshop on using git and github for collaborative coding. This repo will be used as an example of a repo being worked on collaboratively.

# Exercise
We want to write some code to play '21s', which is a simplified form of BlackJack, where we are randomly dealt cards and see how close we get to 21 without going over. 

In this exercise, `A` means ace, `J` means jack, `Q` means queen, and `K` means king. Jokers are discarded. A standard French-suited 52-card deck is assumed, but in most versions, several decks are shuffled together for play. Face cards `J`, `Q`, and `K` are valued at `11`, `12`, and `13`, respectively. Aces can be evaluated as 1 or 11, which ever gets you closer to 21

Our goal is to collectively write all of these scripts. Amongst ourselves, lets decide who is working on what script, with the expectation that every script will have more than one person working on it.

# Task
There are three tasks, each tackled with their own script. All the scripts will be used in a main script that plays BlackJack

1) Calculate value of a card
2) Calculate value of ace
3) Play one round of 21 (single player)
Bonus: Improve the strategy to get 21s more often

I have laid out script templates for (1) and (2), and have made a simple game of 21s. Use the process of writing these scripts to practice:

* making informative commits
* working on branches
* pushing branches to the Github repository
* resolving merge conflicts (local conflicts and conflicts on the remote repo)

# Bonus exercises
If time permits, we will practice:

5) performing code reviews
6) testing other's code
7) using Github Issues to identify and resolve bugs, feature enhancements, etc.
